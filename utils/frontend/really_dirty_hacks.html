        <p>The main part of this application consists of two pianoroll views, that are currently empty. At the top of
            the pianorolls, you can see <span class="tut-high">tab controls</span>.
            If the two pianoroll-views do not appear next to each other, try adjusting your zoom level until they do.
            Musical pieces generated with SCHmUBERT have a fixed length of 64 bars. The pianoroll views are scrollable
            (horizontally).
            In this application, you have 8 slots for musical pieces, the tab control selects, which piece is displayed
            at the left/right pianoroll.

        <p>Now the piece is being generated by SCHmUBERT. Usually this should take only a few seconds, depending on the

        <p>Very well, now you generated your first piece of symbolic music with SCHmUBERT!
            To listen to it, click the <span class="tut-high">Play</span> button.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="mask" title="Alter your piece">
        <p>You can click anywhere in the pianoroll, to skip to that position.
            After you finished listening (stop button is next to the play button), you might have identified a position
            you didn't particularly like (probably the whole piece?).
            You can select a part of the generated piece (draw a rectangle with your mouse) and delete it with the <span
                    class="tut-high">mask button</span>.

    <div id="regen" title="Fill in the gaps">
        <p>SCHmUBERT can now re-generate the notes you masked out. To make the best use of this UI, click on the <span
                class="tut-high">direction button</span>
            once to make the model use the right hand side as source piece, and the left hand side as destination. Then
            click the inpaint button again to start the re-generation process.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="fin1" title="Basics">
        <p> Now you know the basic interactions with the model.
            Use the two views to compare different versions of the same piece.
            The slider on top lets you select the number of timesteps the model uses to generate your pieces (the more
            steps, the longer it will take, but the quality should be better).
            The copy button under the inpaint button copies a piece in the selected direction, but it will only
            overwrite gaps in your destination piece.
            There are some buttons we did not mention previously: next to the stop button there is an undo button (bet
            you know what it does), and next to it, there is a button which lets you download the current
            pianoroll as a MIDI file.
            You can change the instruments which play the melody and the bass voice (dropdowns).
            <br/>
            In the line below, there is a shortcut to select the whole piece, just the melody, bass, drums (choose with
            dropdown., click Select button).
            Finally, you can transpose your current selection with the arrow up/down buttons, and shift it
            backwards/forward in time with the left/right buttons.

        <p>One last feature we did not yet mention: you can upload and extend your own MIDI files!
            If you don't have one at hand right now, you can use <a

                    href="/utils/frontend/mario_original.mid">this one</a> in the meantime.
            Just use the <span class="tut-high">upload button</span>.
            If you do now want to overwrite your pieces, choose an empty slot in the left pianoroll tab control.

    <div id="fin2" title="You are ready">
        <p>Now you are ready to play around with SCHmUBERT! You could an interpolation between two known pieces (use
            upload, time-shift and copy to prepare a piece with a gap for interpolation in between) <br/>
            Remember to turn off the tutorial if you don't want to see it again. <br/>Good luck, have fun!</p>
